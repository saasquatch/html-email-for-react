Feature: CSS Inlining

    Email clients support a range of CSS, but the lowest common denominator is inlined CSS (e.g. no stylesheet support)

    This is a pervasive problem in the web community, and `juice` is a library that hsa broad support that help solve this.

    `juice` is used by a few other tools:
     - mjml
     - SaaSquatch email editor v1 (GrapesJS)


     Scenario: Stylesheets get inlined into the page
